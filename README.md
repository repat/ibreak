iBreak
======
**iBreak** is a list of free and open source iOS apps inspired by [prism-break.org](https://prism-break.org "prism-break") and [droid-break.info](https://droid-break.info "prism-break"). We want to show you high quality alternatives to the big proprietary solutions. 
Please note that open source apps don't guarantee absolute freedom, e.g. an open source Twitter client still sends everything to Twitters' servers. 
Anyway, we believe it's the best we can come up with and that in many cases it's the better choice. 
If you think an app is missing, please write an [email](http://ibreak.info/support.html "support"), a [tweet](https://twitter.com/ibreak "@ibreak"), a [disqus](http://ibreak.info/#disqus "Disqus for ibreak.info") comment or fork the project on github and make a pull request. 

**Of course, github and neocities are not always in sync, so it might take a while for the update to appear.**

Yes, we know that iOS is closed source.

## Technical stuff
* [neocities.org](neocities.org "neocities.org") doesn't allow folders, so everthing is in the main folder. A bit chaotic but it works I guess.
* Please use just plain HTML5/CSS/JS, as no other language is supported(no PHP, Perl, Python, whatsorever)
* Please convert the proprietary images to 25x25 and the free images to 50x50 in the .png format
